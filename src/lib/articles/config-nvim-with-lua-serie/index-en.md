It is important to have a domain of the text editors that we use to develop software, or simply edit texts.
That is why I want to explain how I have one of the most used and stable in the industry, Vim, configured in my work environment.
I want to clarify that we will only be looking at how to configure it, not how to work with Vim/Nvim, but I can recommend those who are starting to watch the series of basic videos on how to improve the productivity of the channel [Compa Compila](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEKs1YXXru5ZKwYh5QKS30w) from youtube. Also, you can learn with:

```sh
 vim

:help
```

or, do the Vim tutor, a 30-minute interactive course for the basic commands

```sh
 vimtutor
```
